# a99 Final Project

This is the COMP 426 final project for Team Mizar. We built a simple website that checks valence scores of user-entered text. We also use the Twitter API to find tweets based on a search term and then calculate average valence score in order to see the sentiment around certain search terms.

## Setup / How to use

We have two npm packages, one for the API and one for the frontend. For more information about API functionality and frontend views, check out the `/docs/` folder.

### API

Install dependencies (for both client and API):
```bash
npm install
cd client/
npm install
cd ..
 ```

Run server:
This defaults to local port 5000, as you'll see in server.js. 
```bash
cd backend/
npm run server
```

Run client:
This defaults to local port 3000.
```bash
cd client/
npm run start
```
