### Our Team's Planning Process

Our team’s planning process began with an initial meeting to introduce ourselves to each other and establish psychological safety amongst our group. We also discussed our objectives and what we wanted to achieve from the project, and then began to brainstorm some ideas for our term project.

Upon discussion, we found commonality in our interests on the mental health effects of COVID-19, and the extent to which those effects could be seen on social media. Furthermore, we wanted to act on these effects by providing mental health resources to social media users evidently struggling with mental health. We narrowed our focus to perform a sentiment analysis of Tweets and highlight that sentiment on our website. In tandem with this analysis, we focused on researching mental health resources that would be helpful to include on our website.

After narrowing our focus to these ideas, we began to identify and assign relevant team roles, including Frontend Lead, Backend Lead, Mental Health Research Lead, Documentation/Project Manager, and NLP/CSS Lead (these roles are discussed in more detail in ..docs/Roles.md).

After establishing clearly defined roles, we began to work more individually while frequently updating each other on our progress through different communication channels. Additionally, we would have periodic meetings to regroup, check each other’s progress, and identify next steps for the coming week(s). We found this combination of role-based, in-depth work – complemented with periodic meetings – to be effective for the remainder of our project.
